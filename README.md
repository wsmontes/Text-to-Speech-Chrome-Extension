## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Speech Not Working?

If the text-to-speech functionality isn't working, try these steps:

1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes the speech synthesis needs a page refresh to initialize properly.

2. **Open settings and test speech**: Click the extension icon and open settings, then use the "Test Speech" button in the Troubleshooting section.

3. **Refresh voices**: Use the "Refresh Voices" button in settings to reload available voices.

4. **Check browser compatibility**:
   - Chrome should have built-in TTS support
   - Make sure your browser is up to date
   - Confirm that no other extensions are blocking TTS

5. **Verify permissions**:
   - Make sure the extension has permission to run on the current site
   - Check that your system audio is working

6. **Known issues and fixes**:
   - Chrome has a bug where speech stops after about 15 seconds (our extension includes a fix)
   - Some websites block content scripts or have CSP restrictions

7. **Language support**:
   - If speech works but in the wrong language, try disabling auto-detection and manually select a language

### Common Issues

- **No sound at all**: Check if your computer's audio is muted
- **Speech cuts off**: This is a known Chrome bug, the extension tries to keep speech alive
- **Wrong language**: Try toggling the auto-detect setting or manually select a language
- **Text not detected**: Some complex page layouts may not work with hover detection

### Advanced Troubleshooting

Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J) and look for messages starting with "TTS Extension".

## üìã Chrome Web Store Permissions

### Storage Permission
The storage permission is required to save user preferences such as selected voice, speech rate, pitch settings, language preferences, and website-specific configurations. This ensures your settings persist across browser sessions.

### ActiveTab Permission
The activeTab permission is necessary to access text content on the current webpage when the user hovers over or selects text. This permission is triggered only when the user actively interacts with the extension and only affects the currently active tab.

### ContextMenus Permission
The contextMenus permission allows the extension to add a right-click menu option for users to select specific text and have it read aloud. This enhances accessibility by providing an alternative to the hover activation method.

### TTS Permission
The Text-to-Speech (tts) permission is essential for the extension's core functionality, allowing it to convert text to audible speech using Chrome's built-in speech synthesis capabilities.

### Host Permission
Host permissions are required for the extension to function across all websites, which is necessary to fulfill its purpose of providing text-to-speech capabilities on any webpage. The extension only accesses visible text content when triggered by user action (hovering or selection) and does not collect or transmit this data.

## üîí Privacy Information

### Data Collection
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. When text is converted to speech, the process happens locally in your browser. No text content, browsing history, or user information is sent to external servers.

- No personally identifiable information is collected
- No website content is stored or transmitted
- User preferences are stored locally in your browser
- No analytics or tracking mechanisms are implemented
